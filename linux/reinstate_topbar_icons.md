# Reinstating topbar icons
The icons on the top bar of the ubuntu desktop (and the status icons on the dock showing which applications are active) sometimes 'disappears'. If this happens, a simple fix is to do `ALT + F2`, then in the 'Enter a command' box that shows up, enter `r` and press enter. This would restart the gnome GUI and reinstate your icons.
